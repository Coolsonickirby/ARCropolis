## QoL improvement suggestion
[Sentences between [brackets] should be removed before posting.]

[Please do not gather multiple suggestions in one issue. If you'd like to suggest multiple things, open multiple issues.]
[Do note that suggestions are only going to be considered for upcoming versions. No feature is going to be backported to an older version (i.e. ``0.9.6``).]


### Is your suggestion related to a usage problem? Please explain.
[If you are requesting a change because something could be made simpler, please give a clear and short description of what is wrong. Ex. ``I have no way of knowing why my mod does not show up``.]

### How could we make this better?
[Describe how you'd like the change to be implemented, if possible. If not, write N/A.]

### Is there an alternative way of doing things you'd like to suggest?
[If what you're asking for is already available but not as good as it could be, please explain. If not, write N/A.]

### Additional information
[You made an illustration to better explain your idea? You'd like to describe your suggestion in more details? Write it here.]
