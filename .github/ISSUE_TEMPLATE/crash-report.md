## Crash report
[Sentences between [brackets] should be removed before posting.]

[Before posting, make sure to check if the ARCropolis version appears on the title screen. If it does not, you did not install it properly and should not open an issue.]
[Please make sure the issue comes from ARCropolis itself by disabling any other plugin you may have and confirming you still can reproduce the crash]

[Only issues related to the latest major version, which is the leftmost number (e.g., ``2`` in version ``2.0.0``), are considered.]
[The previous statement does not apply if the only release in a major version is a beta.]
[Finally, any issues where the user is using SX OS or ReiNX are not considered and issues with said CFW should not be submitted.]

### Your setup
System firmware version: ``11.0.1``
Atmosph√®re version: ``0.18.1``
Smash version: ``11.0.1``
ARCropolis version: ``2.0.0-beta``
microSD card format: ``FAT32`` or ``exFAT``

### Reproducibility 
[Can you reproduce the crash/infinite load? If so, is it random, every time you try, etc.? If you can, providing a zip/rar to reproduce the issue can help]

### What happened and what's the context?
[Were you playing offline? Online? With mods? Was it during the Vs. loading screen? On the CSS? On the SSS? ...]
