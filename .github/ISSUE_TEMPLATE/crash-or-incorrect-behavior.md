[Only issues related to the latest major version, which is the leftmost number (e.g., ``2`` in version ``2.0.0``), are considered.]
[The previous statement does not apply if the only release in a major version is a beta.]
[Finally, any issues where the user is using SX OS or ReiNX are not considered and issues with said CFW should not be submitted.]
